##
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

def fibonacci(n)
  fib = []
  t1 = 0, t2 = 1, nextTerm = 0
  nextTerm = t1 + t2

  while nextTerm <= n do
    fib << nextTerm
    t1 = t2
    t2 = nextTerm
    nextTerm = t1 + t2
  end

  return fib
end

limit = 4000000
numbers = fibonacci(limit)

println numbers.select(lambda (n) do return n % 2 == 0 end)
                .reduce(0, lambda (acc, n) do 
                    acc += n 
                    return acc 
                end)
