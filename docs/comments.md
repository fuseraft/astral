# Comments

## Single line comments

Single line comments begin with a `#`.

```ruby
# this will print "hello"
println "hello"
```

## Multi-line comments

Multiline comments begin with `/#` and end with `#/`.

```
/#
Using a double-# will give you a multiline comment.

Use this to document more complicated logic.

We all love documentation. :)
