# Comments

## Single line comments

Comments should be on their own line.

```
# this will print "hello"
println "hello"
```

## Multi-line comments

*Under construction in new interpreter.*

Multiline comments begin and end with `##`.

```
##
Using a double-# will give you a multiline comment.

Use this to document more complicated logic.

We all love documentation. :)
