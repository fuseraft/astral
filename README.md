# uslang

An unorthodox scripting language written in C++.

```uslang
@proj = "uslang"
@desc = "hybrid-typed, object-oriented"

println "${proj} is a ${desc} scripting language."
```

## Overview

An old passion project I am bringing back to life.

## Build Instructions

To build, open a terminal and run:

```bash
make all
```

## History

I began writing this scripting language as a junior in high school.

It began as a side project to build an alternative shell for Linux and evolved into what it is today.

## TODO

Stay tuned for updates and additions to this README.
