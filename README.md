# uslang

An unorthodox scripting language written in C++.

```uslang
@proj = "uslang"
@desc = "hybrid-typed, object-oriented"

println "#{@proj} is a #{@desc} scripting language."
```

## Overview

An old passion project I am bringing back to life.

## Build Instructions

To build, open a terminal and run:

```bash
make all
```

## History

I began writing this scripting language as a junior in high school. At the time I had called it "ASL" for *another scripting language*.  It began as a side project to build an alternative shell for Linux and evolved into what it is today.

## Etymology

I wanted the language to be my own and to let my own creativity take the language wherever it went. It's not like your typical interpeted language. When I began the project, I had no concept of an abstract syntax tree. To be fair, these were the days of *MySpace*.

I eventually landed on "*unorthodox*", as it is a bit unorthodox and has been since its inception.

## TODO

Stay tuned for updates and additions to this README.
