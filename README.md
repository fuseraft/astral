uslang
===

An unorthodox scripting language written in C++.

```
@project_name = "uslang"
@description = "hybrid-typed, object-oriented, interpreted"

say "\{@project_name} is a \{@description} scripting language."
```

### History

I began writing this scripting language as a junior in high school. At the time I had called it "ASL" for *another scripting language*.  It began as a side project to build an alternative shell for Linux and evolved into what it is today.

### Etymology

I wanted the language to be my own and to let my own creativity take the language wherever it went. It's not like your typical interpeted language. When I began the project, I had no concept of an abstract syntax tree. To be fair, these were the days of *MySpace*.

I eventually landed on "*unorthodox*", as it is a bit unorthodox and has been since its inception.

### TODO

I will add more to this eventually.
